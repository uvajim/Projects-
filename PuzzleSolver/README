This is a puzzle solver that I made. It utilizes an adjaceny list and then runs a topological search breadth first search on proceduraly generated permutations. 
** PREVIOUSLY GENERATED PERMUTATIONS WILL NOT BE VISITED TWICE**

When the goal state is found, it will then print the path using recursion. 

-CURRENT ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED

  -No error checking, so entering an invalid board will result in wrong answers, but sometimes might output "IMPOSSIBLE"
